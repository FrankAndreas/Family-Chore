        "FRESH_CONTEXT: For complex multi-step tasks, suggest chunking work into smaller units. After completing a major milestone (e.g., a full feature or 3+ file edits), remind the user: 'Consider committing and restarting the session for fresh context.' This prevents context rot and RAM buildup.",
